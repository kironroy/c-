#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Why use static variables inside classes?
// One great example is to assign a unique ID to every instance of the class.
// Hereâ€™s an example of that:

class Something {
private:
  static int s_idGenerator;
  int m_id;

public:
  Something() {
    m_id = s_idGenerator++;
  } // grab the next value from the id generator

  int getID() const { return m_id; }
};

// Note that we're defining and initializing s_idGenerator even though
// it is declared as private above.
// This is okay since the definition isn't subject to access controls.

int Something::s_idGenerator = 1; // start our ID generator with value 1

int main() {
  Something first;
  Something second;
  Something third;

  cout << first.getID() << '\n';
  cout << second.getID() << '\n';
  cout << third.getID() << '\n';
  return 0;
}

/*
  Because s_idGenerator is shared by all Something objects,
  when a new Something object is created,
  the constructor grabs the current value out of
  s_idGenerator and then increments the value for the next object.
  This guarantees that each instantiated
  Something object receives a unique id (incremented in the order of creation).
  This can really help when debugging multiple items in an array,
  as it provides a way to tell multiple objects of the same class type apart!
